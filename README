= Module.js =

A minimal module framework for JavaScript.

I only call this a 'framework' because I have coworkers that don't think
they can do a single thing without using some god forsaken 'framework'.

Actually this is just a single function that makes it slightly easier to
define namespaces in your JS code.

== Usage ==

Step 1. include module.js, either via a script tag, or directly in your
javascript source.

Step 2. Use the module(...) function to get the module object, either to
define things in the module or to use them.

== Usage Example ==

var qqq = module("togos.newproject.qqq");


qqq.Thang = function() {
	this.thanginess = 5;
}
qqq.Thang.prototype = {
	"saySomething": function() {
		alert("lawl, I have thanginess of "+this.thangines);
	}
}

== The end ==

Thanks for watching.
